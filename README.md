# SpaceX Project

###### Backend
- I created a Docker container wit PHP and all necessary extinctions I need.
- I knew I would want to use the YML extinctions so I added that.
- I created a function to convert JSON to YML using yaml_emit.
- I created a function to convert JSON to CSV by mapping the JSON to an Array.  

###### Frontend
- I created a basic HTML skeleton to get a feel of the lay out.
- Next I created the JavaScript file that would control the elements rendered on the page
- I then made a function to fetch the data from the JSON file.
- I also created a function to make and render all HTML elements
- Then I added an event listener to listen for an onChange event on the select element.
- That then triggered the function to render the elements to the screen.
- Last add CSS to the page.
